# This is my fork of nrf52-hal. I'm depending on it for the time being, until
# work on it has settled down a bit.
# Ideally we wouldn't need a dependency on nrf52-hal at all, and would depend on
# embedded-hal instead. Unfortunately nrf52-hal doesn't implement the SPI traits
# of embedded-hal yet, and we need nRF52 support because it's used on the
# DWM1001 board.
